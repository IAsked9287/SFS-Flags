# SFS-Flags
Adds flags to the game to make your builds come to life

Do not change/ edit anything without knowing what your doing

**BP editing is highly advised, and some textures might not work with (ex: size 4 fuel tanks so use Bp editing**)

**I recommend using these as fairings and not fuel tanks to overlap fuel tanks which is the purpose of the logos, use a bp editor mod or just normal bp editing to resize the textures to your liking.**

- Argentina Flag
